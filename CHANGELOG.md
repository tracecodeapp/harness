# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

This repo uses Git tags as release boundaries. Version notes below summarize what shipped in each tagged release.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- TypeScript tracer line alignment for debugger-style playback.
- JS/TS runtime coverage around traced queue and traversal steps.

### Notes

- `0.3.4` is a tracer-alignment patch release focused on TypeScript step accuracy.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- JavaScript tracer line mapping for debugger-style playback.
- JS runtime behavior around queue mutations, loop headers, and traversal line alignment.

### Notes

- `0.3.3` improves JS trace semantics without changing the public contract shape.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- JavaScript/TypeScript input binding order during harness execution.

### Notes

- `0.3.2` is a JS/TS execution correctness patch release.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- Python class-scope access instrumentation mangling in the tracing runtime.

### Notes

- `0.3.1` fixes Python access metadata emission for class-based solutions.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- Runtime access metadata in the shared trace contract via an optional `accesses` field on trace steps.
- Public access event types for:
  - `indexed-read`
  - `indexed-write`
  - `cell-read`
  - `cell-write`
  - `mutating-call`
- JavaScript/TypeScript runtime instrumentation for array and grid access events, including indexed reads/writes and mutating queue/array calls.
- Python runtime instrumentation for aligned access metadata during tracing.

### Changed

- Trace adapters now preserve runtime access metadata end to end.
- Runtime contract coverage now validates the new access metadata surface.

### Notes

- `0.3.0` is an additive, backward-compatible contract release.
- Access metadata is state-aligned with debugger-style trace playback, so events appear on the next emitted step alongside the post-line state.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- Structured runtime capability profiles for supported languages.
- Browser runtime capability guards and shared runtime-type metadata.
- Contract tests validating language profiles and declared support levels.

### Notes

- `0.2.0` formalizes the public runtime capability surface consumed by TraceCode.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- Initial public harness baseline with repository documentation and published package metadata.

### Notes

- `0.1.0` is the pre-profile baseline release.
